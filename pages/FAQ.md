### What does the name Snaptics mean?
- Snaptics is a mix of the words "**snap**" and "h**aptics**" that describe two of the defining features of the project: A modular snap style of attachment to build haptic devices.

### Can I use the Snaptics hardware in my project/research?
- Yes! All hardware designs are licensed under the [TAPR Open Hardware License](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/). We welcome and encourage any use of the snaptics platform and we hope you share with us your experiences.

### Where can I purchase the materials for my own Snaptics project?
- All Snaptics materials can be purchased as-is from a variety of sources both online and in brick and mortar hobbyist stores. The specific materials needed for each module are listed in our Hardware Page. We do not endorse any specific suppliers but have used the following in development: SparkFun, Amazon, DigiKey, RadioShack.

### What is the best 3D printer to use?
- Snaptics designs are intended to be printed by any Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) style 3D printer. These are the most common type of 3D printer on the market. We do not endorse any specific brand of 3D printer but have used the following in development: Makerbot Replicator 2X, Creality Ender 5, Prusa i3. If you are building a Snaptics project using a SLA or another type of 3D printer, please let us know at <info@snaptics.org>. We would love to hear how your build goes!

### What 3D printing material should I use?
- Snaptics currently supports prints made in PLA or in ABS. Since these materials have different thermal properties, a scaling factor may be needed depending on which material you are printing in. This factor is detailed on the specific model description on our Downloads Page. If you are building a Snaptics project using a different type of material, please let us know at <info@snaptics.org>. We would love to hear how your build goes! 

### What if I don't have access to a 3D printer?
- Snaptics was designed for manufacture using a 3D printer and currently does not support other build methods. However, we are interested in expanding the accessiblity of this platform. If you are interested in partnering with us to explore this possiblity please contact us at <info@snaptics.org> with ideas!
