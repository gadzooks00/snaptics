### Description
The control module houses the main control circuitry. The current version of the board features a frame, a custom-made printed circuit board, and a Sparkfun ESP32 Development Board. The frame uses a x-lattice structure to stabilize the base of the unit while minimizing material costs. Rather than having the ESP32 control board interface directly with  the  actuators, it connects to female header pins on the PCB. This PCB features a plug for an external power supply, male header pins to connect actuators to, a 5V regulator, and low-side MOSFET control for the ERM motors. The board has eight servo and ERM ports.

### Dimensions
- Base(outer): 78mm x 56.5mm x 5mm
- Frame(inner): 76mm x 40mm
- Board: 75mm x 39mm
