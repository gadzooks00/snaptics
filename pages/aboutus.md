## Snaptics Developers
Snaptics is developed and maintained by the [Mechatronics and Haptic Interfaces Lab](https://mahilab.rice.edu/) at Rice University in Houston, Texas, USA.
While this project began in a single haptics laboratory, our hope is that Snaptics will give researchers, students and makers from many backgrounds access to wearable haptic technology.

## How to Contact Us
If you have any questions regarding the Snaptics project please email us at <info@snaptics.org>. We are also excited to hear about how you use Snaptics. Please send us any information on any projects that you put together with Snaptics. For those of you interested in collaborating to modify and enhance Snaptics designs, please reach out!
