## What is snaptics?
**snaptics** is an open source, low cost, haptics platform designed for rapid prototyping of fully wearable multi-sensory haptic devices. 

There has been growing interest in using haptic devices to enhance virtual experiences or to increase the amount of information transferred to a user by wearable devices. 
As such, the haptics community has proposed a wide range of wearable haptic devices, often featuring multi-sensory cues that convey vibration, squeeze, twist, or skin stretch. 
However, these devices have seen little use outside of the research setting due to their relatively high cost and their complexity of construction. 
Snaptics exists to increase community engagement with and accessibility of wearable haptic devices by lowering the technical barrier to entry and cost of creating a wearable haptic device.
